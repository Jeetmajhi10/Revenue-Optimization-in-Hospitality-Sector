# Project Background
 In the competitive and dynamic hospitality industry, hotels and resorts frequently encounter
 revenue leakages, underutilized capacity, and fluctuating profitability. These challenges arise
 due to factors such as inefficient pricing strategies, inconsistent demand across weekdays and
 weekends, underperformance of specific room types or service offerings, and lack of actionable
 insights from available customer and booking data.
 
This project, undertaken as part of the **Consulting & Analytics Club at IIT Guwahati**, directly confronts these challenges. It presents an end-to-end analytical framework designed to help AtliQ Hotels, a leading hotel chain, identify the root causes of revenue leakage. By leveraging a comprehensive historical dataset, the analysis uncovers critical inefficiencies and proposes data-backed strategies to optimize pricing, enhance product offerings, and improve overall profitability. The final output is not just a report, but a strategic roadmap for informed, data-driven decision-making.

 Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

 - **Revenue Trend Analysis:**  Evaluation of historical revenue patterns, both by property name and by region, focusing on RevPar and Average Daily Revenue (ADR).
 - **Bookings Analysis:**  Distribution of bookings across room class, platform, and day type, understanding the reason behind revenue leakage.
 - **Generated vs Realized:**  An evaluation of actual revenue realized by the properties and how deviated it is from the revenue generated.
 - **What‑If ROI Simulator:**  Models how modest increases in premium bundling, cancellation mitigation, or direct‑booking shifts can recapture millions and improve ROI up to ~2%.

An interactive Power BI dashboard used to analyze and explore the above-mentioned insights can be found here. [link](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/0be65715-f1d4-4d39-bb05-89f79e85f4bb/1781d5352c50911cbc29?experience=power-bi)
